## Future Enhancements üöß

### Phase 6: Multi-threaded Downloading
**Goal**: Parallel chunk downloads for performance

**Planned Features**:
- [ ] Implement worker pool with configurable size (default: 4)
- [ ] Add job queue with concurrency control
- [ ] Coordinate progress tracking across workers
- [ ] Add rate limiting to respect registry limits
- [ ] **Validation**: Compare download time vs sequential download

**Design Considerations**:
- Use `sync.WaitGroup` for worker coordination
- Channel-based job distribution
- Mutex-protected progress updates
- Configurable via `--concurrency` flag

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

---

### Phase 7: Authentication Support
**Goal**: Support private registries

**Planned Features**:
- [ ] Implement `--credential=<USER:PASSWORD>` flag parsing
- [ ] Add HTTP Basic Auth header to registry requests
- [ ] Add token-based auth flow (for registries like Docker Hub)
- [ ] Support Docker config.json credential helper
- [ ] Add credential caching
- [ ] **Validation**: Download from a private registry with credentials

**Design Considerations**:
- Secure credential handling (no logging)
- Token refresh logic
- Support multiple auth schemes
- Integration with Docker credential helpers

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

---

### Phase 11: Checksum Verification
**Goal**: Verify download integrity

**Planned Features**:
- [ ] Extract checksums from stargz TOC
- [ ] Verify file content after download
- [ ] Report verification errors clearly
- [ ] Add `--skip-verify` flag for fast downloads
- [ ] **Validation**: Detect and report corrupted downloads

**Design Considerations**:
- Use checksums from TOC entries if available
- Compute SHA256 during download (streaming)
- Compare with expected checksum
- Fail fast on mismatch

**Estimated Effort**: Small (1 day)

---

### Phase 12: Exponential Backoff

**Planned Features**:
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Add jitter to avoid thundering herd
- [ ] Configurable backoff parameters
- [ ] Respect Retry-After headers
